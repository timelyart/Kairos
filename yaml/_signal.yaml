# This example demonstrated how to use signals. Signals work by comparing current values of indicators on TradingView charts.
# Unlike alerts (see _alert.yaml) nothing is created on TradingView itself and signals are not 'saved'.
# You can, however, 'save' them in a watchlist, send a summary mail or save it in a Google Spreadsheet
#
# Use a url + other settings per type of signal you want to set
# Note that all values are case sensitive
# Define one or more charts by providing the link(s) to your charts
charts:
- url: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/<my_chart>/
  # Define for which time frames you want to generate signals
  timeframes: [1 day]
  # Define one or more watchlists
  watchlists: ["<my_watchlist>"]
  # Signals listed must be available from the chart which is loaded through the 'url' parameter
  # The chart has to be configured to 'Auto (Fits Data To Screen)'. If it isn't then you may get false positives.
  # Note that signal results are communicated immediately if a 'summary' section is found in this file.
  # This particular example assumes you have the Golden Cross by Chuckytuh on your chart
  signals:
  - name: "Golden cross"
    # Define one or more indicators that together provide one signal
    # For example, you can combine two indicators e.g. MA cross and RSI. At least one of the indicators must have a signal defined.
    # A signal is only created if the trigger of all indicators is fired. If there is no trigger defined then it counts as having fired.
    indicators:
        # Kairos will look for the first indicator on a pane within a chart that starts with the value defined below
      - name: "Golden Cross"
        # A TradingView layout is divided into charts.
        # Use 0 for the 1st chart on your layout, 1 for the 2nd, etc. The top-left chart has always index 0.
        # Unfortunately, the order of charts within a TradingView layout isn't consistent and may change over time.
        # You can find the chart indices depending on your layout here: <link to image>
        # Note! For the most consistent results use only the most top-left chart at index 0.
        chart_index: 0
        # Charts are further subdivided into panes. This will tell Kairos on which pane the indicator is.
        # Use 0 for the 1st pane on your chart, 1 for the 2nd pane, etc. The top pane has always index 0.
        # Unlike the chart_index above, panes are consistently ordered from top to bottom with the top pane being 0.
        pane_index: 0
        # Optional. Find the index based upon it's number instead of name (see above). The index takes precedence over the name.
        # If you have multiple indicators with the same name, e.g. EMA, then you'll need to define the index as well as the name.
        # NOTE: if you remove and then add an indicator the order and indices of indicators will most likely have changed.
        indicator_index: 0
        # Optional. Define how this indicator will (partly) trigger the signal.
        # A trigger is defined by equating a left-hand side with a right-hand side.
        # Although optional, at least one of the indicators should have a trigger defined.
        trigger:
          # The left and right hand side can have one (or both) of the following values:
          # - index: indicator provided value found at the defined index
          # - value: a literal value which can be anything
          # If both index and value are set, then index will take precedence
          left-hand-side:
            index: 2
            value:
            # list of values to ignore, e.g. you can use this to ignore 'n/a' values
            ignore: [n/a, 0.0000]
          right-hand-side:
            index:
            value: "n/a"
            ignore:
          # Define how the equation should be processed. Possible values are: =, <=, >=, <, >, != (use quotation marks)
          type: "!='
        # Optional. Add values at certain indices in the form of <key>:<index>.
        # You can use any string for a key. All keys with their values defined here are keywords that can be used with 'text'and 'csv' (see further below).
        # Note: that names for keys need to be unique among all indicators defined within this signal

    # List of charts (url's) to include
    # You can use %SYMBOL and %TIMEFRAME as keywords to make the link more specific (use quotation marks)
