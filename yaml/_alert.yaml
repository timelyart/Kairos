# This example creates alerts on TradingView in the same way as you would do normally by hand (just automated)
# Use a url + other settings per type of alert you want to set
# Note that all values are case sensitive
# Define one or more charts by providing the link(s) to your charts
charts:
- url: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/<my_chart>/
  # Define for which time frames you want to generate alerts
  timeframes: [1 day]
  # Define one or more watchlists
  watchlists: ["<my_watchlist>"]
  # Create alerts on TradingView
  # Alert listed under alerts must be available from the chart which is loaded through the 'url' parameter
  # This particular example assumes you have the Golden Cross by Chuckytuh on your chart
  alerts:
    # The name is used to identify already existing alerts on your alert list in TradingView and is used to purge/update previously added alerts
    # Make sure the name is unique
  - name: "Golden Cross"
    # Optional. When set, the interval will be omitted from links in the alert. This is useful if you want to link to a multiple chart layout. Default is no.
    # Please, note that Kairos will only process and set an alert on the first chart (top/left) in a multi chart layout.

    # Kairos tries to find conditions based upon the values you provide below.

    # It is sufficient to only set the first word for each condition.
    conditions: ["Golden", "Plot", "Crossing Up", "Golden", "Plot"]
    # The options below correspond with the options on the Alert dialog, as are the available values for each option.
    # How often is the alert allowed to triggers?

    # When should the alert expire?
    expiration:
      # Future date time (note TradingView uses local time to set expiration and Kairos will check the computer's time against TV expiration).
      # Format it in yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm, or n where n is the number of days (note that trading view has a maximum of 60).
      # time: 2019-05-19 13:42, or delta in minutes (max 86400, or 60 days), or leave empty to use TradingView's default of 30 days (somewhat improves performance).
